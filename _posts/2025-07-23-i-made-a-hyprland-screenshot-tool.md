## My New Tool
Nothing to crazy. But I basically just added onto what the [grimblast](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib/tree/main/grimblast) script/tool does for the AUR and added my own stuff onto it, whilst adding some other things. The full feature list in on GitHub and you can find it here: https://github.com/thesyntaxslinger/Hyprland-Screenshot-Script

## Future Plans?
I will probably just update it and keep the git repo updated until I'm satisfied.
