# Paperless-ngx - Simple Document Organisation

The greatest software to track your documents and to go... Paperless!

## Installation

Paperless-ngx is a pretty heavy python app. The devs recommend to use docker, but we are not a fan of docker here, so we are going to install it in an LXC bare-metal manually ourselves.

First thing we should do is grab the latest Paperless-ngx release.
