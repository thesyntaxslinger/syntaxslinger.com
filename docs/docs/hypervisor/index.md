# Proxmox Virtual Environment

For my hypervisor of choice, I have gone with Proxmox Virtual Environment. Mainly because it is the hypervisor of choice for many other homelabbers out there, and it is free and open source.

## How To Install

You can install Proxmox Virtual Environment by obtaining a copy of their ISO installer, which you can then flash onto a boot device of your choice and install it.

You can also install it straight on top of a Debian 13 installation due to Proxmox being designed on top of Debian already (this is mostly for storage setups that the default installer cannot do).

You can find the ISO file from the offical Proxmox website [here](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).
