# Introduction

Welcome to my homelab documentation!  

Here, I share the journey of how I built, broke, and rebuilt the projects that now power my everyday setup.  

## How did we get here?

What started as a small experiment with a repurposed desktop running Debian 11 has gradually evolved into a fully-fledged homelab environment. Over time, I’ve explored everything from self-hosted services and automation to networking experiments and data backups, all fueled by curiosity and a desire to understand how things really work behind the scenes.

## Why Homelab?

There’s something deeply satisfying about building your own infrastructure, knowing every service, every config file, and every failure that helped shape it.  
For me, the homelab is both a playground and a classroom. It’s where I test new technologies, automate boring stuff, and keep learning long after the workday ends.

## What to Expect

In these pages, I’ll document each part of my setup, from server provisioning and networking to backups, containers, and monitoring tools.  
Expect a mix of tutorials, troubleshooting notes, and personal insights from lessons learned along the way.  

While some parts dive deep into configurations and scripts, others are simple overviews to help you get started quickly. My goal isn’t to show *the* right way, but *a* working way, one that’s been tested in a real, constantly evolving homelab.

This site serves as both a reference for myself and a guide for anyone looking to dive into homelabbing. Whether you’re starting out with an old machine or already have a few servers humming away in the corner, I hope you’ll find something useful, or at least interesting, along the way.
