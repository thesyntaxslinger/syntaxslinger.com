# Overview

Networking is the main fun in homelabbing. When I first got into homelabbing, I setup test environments to practice for when I got my first VPS and hardened it.

Through setting up my own homelab, I have learnt things that would be considered *obsecure* like IPv6 for example.

I have managed to figure out ways to expose services in my homelab even though I am behind CG-NAT for my home LAN, which is pretty great.
